The analysis will cover multiple aspects, including string manipulation, column renaming, data type changes, and various productivity metrics.

#### Key Tasks

- String Manipulation or Transformation
- Renaming Column Names
- Changing Date Time to Date
- Creating a New Column for Team Average
- Finding the Top Performer for Each Use Case in May
- Evaluating Managerial Performance in Postcursor_Audits_L1
- Identifying Top Performers for Each Manager
- Identifying Employees Performing Below Team Average
- Analyzing Weekly Variations in Employee Productivity


#### Key Questions for Employee Productivity Analysis

1. **Create a new column `team_average` to track the average productivity per use case each day?**

2. **Which employees were the top performers for each use case during the month of May?**

3. **Among managers, who leads the most productive team in handling `Postcursor_Audits_L1` cases?**

4. **Who are the top two performers under each manager based on productivity metrics?**

5. **Which employees are performing below the team average for their respective tasks?**

6. **What insights can we derive from the week-to-week variations in employee productivity?**
